NWChem is a computational chemistry package that is designed to run on
high-performance parallel supercomputers as well as conventional workstation
clusters. It aims to be scalable both in its ability to treat large problems
efficiently, and in its usage of available parallel computing resources.
NWChem has been developed by the Molecular Sciences Software
group of the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) at the
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Most of the implementation
has been funded by the EMSL Construction Project.

<B>Anncouncing NWChem-5.1
</b>
<br><br>

The NWChem development team is pleased to announce the release of NWChem version
5.1. This release includes a number of new capabilities, new supported platforms
and bug fixes.  Major highlights in this release include:
<br>
<br>

<h3> Available on latest platforms: </h3>
<ul>
NWChem supports the IBM BlueGene/L and the Cray XT3/XT4 (Compute Node Linux)
platforms, with computational scalability of up to at least 1024 processors. In
addition, NWChem now supports Infiniband/OpenIB network.
</ul>

<h3> New accurate energetics and properties calculations: </h3>
<ul>
a coupled-cluster linear response is now available using both restricted and
unrestricted references. Ground-state dynamic polarizabilities at the
coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and triples levels of theory are now
available. Second order approximate coupled-cluster model with singles and
doubles (CC2) is available for excited states. In addition, performance
improvements have been made in both time-to-solution and memory usage.
</ul>

<h3> Better modeling of heavy element chemistry: </h3>
<ul>
The new spin-orbit zeroth-order relativistic approximation (ZORA) is available
in both the Gaussian and plane wave density functional theory modules, providing
a framework for heavy element chemistry simulations. In addition, the spin-orbit
Douglas-Kroll approach is now available.
</ul>

<h3> New science possible with plane wave module: </h3>
<ul>
Users of NWChemâ€™s plane wave code can now use Fermi smearing to model metals. In
addition, the plane wave module can now handle any general pseudopotential, and
performance improvements enable faster time-to-solution and improved scalability.
</ul>

<h3> Users contribute new capabilities to NWChem: </h3>
<ul>
The constrained density functional theory method developed by the Van Voorhis
Group is now available. In addition, the Truhlar group has made their latest M06
density functional available in NWChem.
</ul>

A full list of new capabilities and changes is available in the release notes

The suite utilizes parallel-programming tools developed by PNNL staff.
Most of the tool and scalable algorithm development has been funded by the
High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative (HPCCI)
grand-challenge software program and the <a href="http://acts.nersc.gov" target="_blank">
DOE-2000 ACTS Tools</a> project.
