Things to follow up on
----------------------
o Frozen orbitals do not work for energies.

Wish list of additional features
-------------------------------
o convergence of amplitudes should be measured with residuals,
  not updates. (RJH)
o Norms of amplitudes & related measures
o Largest amplitudes
o CCD (because its there)
o Compression and/or GA storage of iterates for DIIS
o Control to switch off DIIS entirely

Notable changes to code
-----------------------
o Began user's guide documentation
o PRINT input directive renamed to IPRT to make room for standard
  NWChem PRINT controls
o Starting to add NWChem-style print controls to objects
o Made term debugging switches available via input deck (not sure if
  this is really a good idea or not!)
o Commented out calls to rtc (doesn't exist on Solaris, links, but
  does not work as intended on IBM)
o Eliminated RSize & ISize
o Made DIIS subspace size an input directive (DIISBAS)
o /para1/ replaced with called to GA_NodeID() and GA_NNodes()
o /len/ turned into ccsd_len.fh include file
o /debug/ turned into ccsd_debug.fh include file
o Implicit NONE in all routines
o Default convergence threshold 1.0e-8 --> 1.0e-6 at suggestion of RJH
