Things to follow up on
----------------------
o /para1/ should be replaced with called to GA_NodeID() and
  GA_NNodes().  RSize and ISize have already been eliminated from the
  code. 
o Frozen orbitals do not work for energies.
o Common blocks should be in include files: /len/, /debug/ (/para1/ done)

Wish list of additional features
-------------------------------
o Norms of amplitudes & related measures
o Largest amplitudes
o CCD (because its there)
o Compression and/or GA storage of iterates for DIIS
o Control to switch off DIIS entirely

Notable changes to code
-----------------------
o Began user's guide documentation
o PRINT input directive renamed to IPRT to make room for standard
  NWChem PRINT controls
o Starting to add NWChem-style print controls to objects
o Made term debugging switches available via input deck (not sure if
  this is really a good idea or not!)
o Commented out calls to rtc (doesn't exist on Solaris, links, but
  does not work as intended on IBM)
o Converted /PARA1/ into include file & eliminated RSize & ISize
o Made DIIS subspace size an input directive (DIISBAS)
