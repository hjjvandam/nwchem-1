In some cases, the current implementation has been left with some
holes to fill in for generality.

General
o Approximations other than V, especially assymetric, not well tested.

driver_xf:
o No dynamic block sizing
o xform_3cint should be modified to write out both 2-index and 3-index
  transformed integrals to speed the assymmetric split of the SVS and
  V approximations.
o Schwarz screening for other than V approximation?

driver_e:
o dynamic block sizing out of date
o either p2ij or p2ab will work only if entire amplitude tensor is in core
o P2 is wrong size in case of frozen core
o NMO probably not needed in routine
o Don't pass in both NFit and FitBas

driver_g:
o l2 uses ga_matmul_patch and is therefore not scalable
