Tools libraries reside under /msrc/proj/hpctools AFS volume.  Use
get-tools script to checkout the files for the first time.  get-tools
tries to figure out if you have local access to the repository, and if
not looks at the EMSL_USER environment variable to setup a reasonable
CVSROOT.  For more complex situations, you may need to modify the
script.
