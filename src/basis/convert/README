This documents how to convert basis sets as output by Dave Fellers
gbasis program in nwchem format into NWCHEM library format.


The most time consuming steps cannot be automated since
they require assesment of the correctness of the contents.
A useful command is
  
   egrep '^BASIS|^END|^Effec' NWCHEM.BSLIB

1) Remove duplicate basis sets 
2) Look for obvious errors in data from Dave
3) Ensure that all basis sets are terminated with END
   (if not it could be a problem in data from Dave. 
   DFT basis sets seem to be an exception)
4) Ensure ECPs are present where they should be and that in 
   a basis set family that they appear AFTER the corresponding
   basis sets (introduced with 'Effective core potentials').
5) Replace '! #' with '#' (ECPs only?).
6) nawk -f bas.awk < NWCHEM.BSLIB > library
7) look at the output

I have a set of scripts that will eventually run calculations for all
of the basis sets and ECPs for all atoms.  This is not yet finished.
