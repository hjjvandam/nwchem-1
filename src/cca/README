change config.txt if necessary and source it
compile NWChem with target nwdft
(include dft grid if standalone NWChem doesn't link)
Note that hessian modules is not included for target nwdft
For target nwdft util.o is generated twice (one of them needs to be renamed)
copy all object files to nwchem-4.7/obj by using
find ./ -name "*.o" -exec cp {} ~/nwchem-4.7/obj \; -print
create obj directory outside nwchem build and copy Makefile.sumo over there
make -f Makefile.sumo
go to nwchem-4.7/src/cca/build source config.txt and type make
make install
cd nwchem-4.7/src/cca
