1. change config.txt if necessary and source it
   set the environment variable LIBMPI if your mpi library is not '-lmpi'

   make and include -ldftgrad if standalone NWChem doesn't link
   Note that hessian modules is not included for target nwdft
   make geninterface module
   
3. copy all object files to nwchem-4.7/obj and link them
  cd nwchem-4.7/src/cca
  make -f Makefile.sumo

4. build nwchem-cca component
   create a build directory
   configure (there is a sample configure script config.txt under cca directory)
   make
   make install

5. test nwchem-cca component
   cd nwchem-4.7/src/cca/test
   ccafe-single --ccafe-rc CCAFERC

6. changes made in nwchem-4.7 package
   * two files under nwchem-4.7/src/config has been modified
