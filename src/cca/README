1. change the environment variables in env_nwchem.source
   and source the file

2. make sure that the cca tools are compiled

3. compile the cca-chem-generic code
 setenv CVSROOT :ext:vidhya@cca-forum.org:/cvs/cca-chem
 setenv CVS_RSH ssh

4. compile NWChem with NWCHEM_MODULES "nwdft gradients"
   This should generally just be two commands:
   "make nwchem_config"
   "make >& make.log &"
   make and include -ldftgrad if standalone NWChem doesn't link
   Note that hessian modules is not included for target nwdft
   "make stubs.o" in the $(NWCHEM_TOP)/src directory
   make in the geninterface directory
   
5. copy all object files to nwchem-4.7/obj and link them by:
   cd $(NWCHEM_TOP)/cca
   make -f Makefile.sumo

6. build nwchem-cca component
   change config.txt if necessary and source it or do your own configure
   set the environment variable LIBMPI if your mpi library is not '-lmpi'
   make
   make install

7. test nwchem-cca component
   cd $(NWCHEM_TOP)/src/cca/tests
   modify CCAFERC file
   ccafe-single --ccafe-rc CCAFERC

8. changes made in nwchem-4.7 package
   * two files under nwchem-4.7/src/config has been modified
   * "hess_read" has been removed from NWChemWrapper.F
   * compile dftgrad module
   * compile geninterface module
