In each standard symmetry, there are typically more than one supersymmetry.
It is therefore neccesary to define how the orbitals within a given 
standard symmetry are ordered. There are two such orderings in action

1: The orbitals within a given standard symmetry are ordered in the same way as the basis-functions. From the information about the ordering of the basis functins, we can therefore determine the ordering of the molecular orbitals. This ordering is the standard order of the orbitals

ISTA_TO_GENSM_REO gives the ordering from super-symmetry block ordering
to standard symmetry

ISTA_TO_GNSYM: ISTA_TO_GNSYM(I): 
I is index for orbital ordered according to general symmetry
(blocks of supersymmetry), 
ISTA_TO_GNSYM(I) is the corresponding orbital in standard order

2: The orbitals within a given standard symmetry are ordered  as specified by
   the GAS_SP arrays. This ensures that orbitals of correct super-symmetry 
   are put in the various gaspaces.  I will call this ordering the actual order.
   WORK(KMO_STA_TO_ACT_REO) gives the ordering from the standard order to
   the actual order. This is an internal ordering within each standard symmetry
   block.
MO_STA_TO_ACT_REO(I): I is orbital in standard order, MO_STA_TO_ACT_REO(I)
is the orbital in gas-order 

We want super-symmetry order to actual symmetry 
Supersym  => standard => actual

MO_STA_TO_ACT_REO(ISTA_TO_GNSYM(ISUP) must do the trick


When supersymmetry is active the orbitals are in the program in actual order.
When reorganizing to super-symmetry blocks we need:
1: Reorder from actual order to standard order
2: Reorder from standard order to super-symmetry blocks
The array accomplishing this reorder is the IACT_TO_GENSM_REO reorder
