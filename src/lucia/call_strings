The codes for that generates and manipulates strings as products of GAS-spaces

GETSTR_TOTSM_SPGP: Generates all strings belonging to a given supergroup and 
                   symmetry
                   - GETSTRN_GASSM_SPGP: Generates all strings for given 
                     symmetries of all strings - changed

GETSTR_ALLSM_GNSPGP: Generates all strings of general supergroup and all symmetries
                    -GETSTRN_GASSM_GNSPGP: Generates all strings for given
                     symmetries of all strings
GETSTR2_TOTSM_SPGP: Generates all strings of general supergroup and all symmetries
                  : Used extensively in Modern codes as IC - changed
