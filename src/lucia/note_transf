A note on the transformation of integrals(modern times, ie. ROUTE = 2)

An integral transformation requires

1) Input integrals:
   Spatial and permutational symmetries
   Values of integrals
2) Transformation matrices from input to output   
3) Output integrals:
   Restrictions
   Permutational and spatial symmetries
   Address for storing integrals

Input integrals (are by assumption a complete set of integrals)

Spatial and permutational symmetry: 

Location of input and output integrals
---------------------------------------
KINT1O => KINT1
KINT2 => Arrays defined by active integral list,
single array list:  KINT2 => KINT2_A(IIE2ARR)
KINT2 is typically not an allocated array, but points
to an allocated array ( nearly a pointer to a pointer), say
KINT_2EMO, say
KINT_2EMO

*. Form of list of output integrals
------------------------------
Defined by  IE2LIST_A, IOCOBTP_A = 1, INTSM_A = 1
IE2LIST_A gives the type/number of the output integral list

The types of the output integral arrays are then given by
IE2LIST_I(IE2LIST_IB(IE2LIST_A-1+I)), where I = 1 for a list
containing a single array, and I=1,2,... for a list containing
several integral arrays.

The address of the output integrals is given by 
KINT2_A(IE2LIST_I(IE2LIST_IB(IE2LIST_A-1+I))) and the 
dimensions are given by
NINT2_G(IE2LIST_I(IE2LIST_IB(IE2LIST_A-1+I)))

*.Transformation matrices

*. Defined by KKCMO_I, KKCMO_J, KKCMO_K, KKCMO_L

Integral fetching
-----------------
The integral fetchers use  IH1FORM, IH2FORM to define 
the permutational symmetry of the one-and two-electron integrals,
respectively.

Address of the two-electon integrals: 
The first list of integrals containing the given form
is first obtained by GET_INTARR_F4TP.  This list is subsequently 
used.

The one-electron integrals are fetched from KINT1 
(under guidance of I_UNRORB.EQ.0.OR.ISPCAS.EQ.1)
