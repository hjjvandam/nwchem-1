* In lucia, configurations are described in at least three different ways
* Consider a space with NORB active orbitals and NEL active electrons
*
* Accumulated form: An array of dimension NORB, giving in element I the 
*                   accumulated occupation upto and including orbital I
* Expanded form   : An array of dimension NEL giving in element I
*                   occupied orbital number I
* packed form     : An array of dimension less of equal NEL giving
*                   in element I, the I'th occupied orbital. 
*                   A doubly ocupied orbital is given a minus.
* Occupation number: an array of dimension NORB, giving in element I, the 
*                    occupation of orbital I.
*
* The routine ILEX_FOR_CONF requires the configuration in packed form.
