# Build NWChem
# ============
#
# This script compiles a statically linked executable of NWChem
# with the gcc and gfortran compilers. This script expects to run
# in the top level NWChem directory (i.e. above src).
#
# The script takes at most one argument. This way you can use to
# build NWChem by simply invoking 
#
#    ./contrib/distro-tools/build_nwchem
#
# and similarly clean everything up by invoking
#
#    ./contrib/distro-tools/build_nwchem realclean
#
# Other builds can be generated by changing the compiler options and
# the environment variables as needed.
#
# The main advantages of this script are:
# 1. That you have a record of exactly how you compiled a binary.
# 2. You don't need any environment variables set in your general user
#    environment, allowing you full flexibility to switch between
#    different builds in different directories without getting caught
#    out by variable settings you forgot about.
