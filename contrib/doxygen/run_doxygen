# Doxygen run script for NWChem
#
# Doxygen is a source code documentation tool. It interprets and analyses
# the source code and writes a substantial chunk of documentation. The 
# documentation can be enriched by providing more details in comment lines.
# Doxygen is the defacto standard approach to documenting C-code. 
#
# This script has been designed to be run in the $NWCHEM_TOP directory,
# and producing a directory with documentation in $NWCHEM_TOP/srcdoc.

 This script runs doxygen building a particular version of the NWChem
 source code documentation. The command line flags are:

 -h Show this information

 -g Generate the full NWChem documentation, including various graphs such
    as call trees, include trees, caller trees, etc. This is most useful
    when information about how the code is put together is required.
    This level of documentation takes the longest to generate and requires
    the most disk space (about 80 minutes and generating around 4 GB of HTML).

 -t (Default) Generate text only NWChem documentation. No graphs are generated
    but headers and comments are included. This level of documentation is
    useful when the information about how to use a module is required.
    (Takes about 15 minutes and generates 300 MB of HTML).

 -m Generate NWChem manpages. This is similar to the text only documentation
    except that this documentation is formatted as UNIX manpages. This 
    documentation is relatively compact (takes about 10 minutes and generates
    around 200 MB).

 -u Update the Doxygen configurations files to a newer version of Doxygen.

 -v Print the version information from the configuration files, Doxygen,
    and the GraphViz dot program.
