# Doxygen run script for NWChem
#
# Doxygen is a source code documentation tool. It interprets and analyses
# the source code and writes a substantial chunk of documentation. The 
# documentation can be enriched by providing more details in comment lines.
# Doxygen is the defacto standard approach to documenting C-code. 
#
# Experience on NWChem so far has shown that this is challenging with 
# Doxygen generating many error messages and even seg-faulting.
#
# This script has been designed to be run in the $NWCHEM_TOP directory,
# and producing a directory with documentation in $NWCHEM_TOP/srcdoc.
