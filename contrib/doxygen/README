DOXYGEN README
==============

This directory contains experimental material to generate source code
documentation using Doxygen. 

To generate the source code documentation run

	cd $NWCHEM_TOP
	./contrib/docygen/run_doxygen

After this $NWCHEM_TOP/srcdoc/html should contain the source code documentation.
At the moment very few files of NWChem have been provided with the appropriate
comments. Hence the Doxygen documentation essentially only contains what
the tool can extract from the source code itself.

More information on Doxygen can be found at:

 - http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen

Experience so far has shown that the tool cannot easily cope with a code as
large as NWChem.
