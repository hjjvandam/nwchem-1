DOXYGEN README
==============

This directory contains experimental material to generate source code
documentation using Doxygen. 

To generate the source code documentation run

	cd $NWCHEM_TOP
	./contrib/docygen/run_doxygen

After this $NWCHEM_TOP/srcdoc/html should contain the source code documentation.
At the moment very few files of NWChem have been provided with the appropriate
comments. Hence the Doxygen documentation essentially only contains what
the tool can extract from the source code itself.

More information on Doxygen can be found at:

 - http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen

Experience so far has been mixed:
- Doxygen requires the right configuration settings to deal with Fortran
  code.
- Doxygen does not recognize .F files as Fortran.
- Doxygen's EXTENSION_MAPPING does not work for files with capitals in their
  extension.
- Doxygen requires source code modifications to work with NWChem. See details
  below.
- Doxygen generates about 4 GB of documentation for the NWChem source tree
  in about 1 hour and 20 minutes.

INSTALLING DOXYGEN FOR NWCHEM
=============================

Prerequisites: Doxygen works best if the graphviz package is available to 
draw call graphs and such like. It uses the executable "dot". All that is 
required is to build and install graphviz so that "dot" is in your PATH.
I tried Doxygen with graphviz-2.28.0.

Installing Doxygen itself is relatively straightforward. Download the Doxygen
package of your choice (the version with which I have tested this setup is
listed at the top of doxygen.rc). To have Doxygen recognize .F files do the
following:

	cd doxygen-<version>/src/.
	vi util.cpp
	- search for: updateLanguageMapping(".f", "fortran");
	- add the line: updateLanguageMapping(".F", "fortran");
	./configure --prefix <install dir>
	make
	make install

After this you should be able to run Doxygen as described at the top of this
file.

Happy coding, Huub.
