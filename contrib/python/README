A collection of miscelaneous Python scripts and test cases 
that have been partially tested.

nwgeom.py - look in the file for (a little) more documentation
   Defines the procedures

   - coords = geom_get_coords(name)
   - geom_set_coords(name,coords)
     Get/set cartesian coordinates for named geometry

   - bond_length(i,j)
     Compute bond length between atoms i & j for
     default geometry

   - (xmin, fmin) = minimize1d(f, xlo, xhi, xtol, maxeval)
     Fairly robust minimization in 1d ... useful for crude
     localization of saddle points.

   - results = scan_input(input,start,end,nstep,theory,task)
     Scan parameters from start to end, substituting into 
     the NWChem input string and calling the specified
     task(theory), returning results from each step in results.

ts_search.nw
     Example use of minimize1d from nwgeom.py

scanexp.nw
     Example use of scan_input from nwgeom.py

hcn.nw
     Scans the HCN -> CNH reaction path displaying bond lengths
     and the energy as function of angle using Gnuplot.  You
     need Python and the GNUplot and Numeric extensions
     (www.python.org)

nh3.nw
     Scans the NH3 inversion path displaying bond lengths
     and the energy as function of angle using Gnuplot.  You
     need Python and the GNUplot and Numeric extensions
     (www.python.org)
     
isdoesmic.nw
     Uses python to compute a reaction energy as a function
     of basis set.
