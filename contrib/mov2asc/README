This is a pair of programs that translate between NWChem movecs files
in the usual binary format and an ASCII form that can be moved to
abother platform and converted back into a binary file for that
machine.  They are quite simple, and don't do much error checking, but
they seem to work.

Known to work on KSR, Cray-T3D.
Requires NWChem's include files and libutil.a containing the MA
library.
