This is a pair of programs that translate between NWChem movecs files
in the usual binary format and an ASCII form that can be moved to
another platform and converted back into a binary file for that
machine.  They are quite simple, and don't do much error checking, but
they seem to work.

Known to work on Sun and SGI
Requires NWChem's include files and libutil.a containing the MA
library.
