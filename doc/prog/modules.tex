% new chapter on Molecular Calculation Modules

\label{sec:modules}

The molecular calcluation modules are the high level molecular
calculation programs within NWChem.  They are essentially independent
programs that perform the various functions invoked by the
task directives, using the appropriate theory for a specified
operation.  This chapter describes each module in detail under
the appropriate theory heading below.  The various operations
that can be performed with the different modules are also described.

\section{Theories}

There are modules in NWChem to support ten different theory options
for molecular calculations.  
\begin{itemize}
 \item Self-Consistent Field (SCF) or Hartree-Fock
 \item Density Functional Theory (DFT) for molecules
 \item Density Functional Theory for periodic systems (GAPPS)
 \item MP2 using a fully direct or semi-direct algorithm
 \item MP2 using the Resolution of the Identity (RI) approximation
 \item Coupled-cluster single and double excitations
 \item Multiconfiguration SCF
 \item Selected configuration interaction with perturbation
   correction 
 \item Classical molecular dynamics simulation using nwARGOS
\end{itemize}


The following subsections describe the internal program structure of each
of these modules.

\section{Operations}

Operations are specific calculations performed in a task, using the level of
theory specified by the user.  
The following list gives the selection of operations currently
available in NWChem:
\begin{itemize}
\item Evaluate the single point energy.
\item Evaluate the derivative of the energy with respect to\
   nuclear coordinate gradient.
\item Minimize the energy by varying the molecular
   structure.
\item Conduct a search for a transition state (or saddle point). 
\item Calculate energies on a LST path defined by means of
a z-matrix input.
\item Compute second derivatives 
and print out an analysis of molecular vibrations.
\item Compute molecular dynamics using nwARGOS.
\item Perform multi-con\-fig\-ura\-tion
  thermo\-dynamic integ\-ration using nwARGOS.
\end{itemize}
