\label{sec:functionality}

NWChem provides many methods to compute the properties of molecular and
periodic systems using standard quantum mechanical descriptions of the
electronic wavefunction or density.  In addition, NWChem has the
capability to perform classical molecular dynamics and free energy
simulations.  These approaches may be combined to perform mixed
quantum-mechanics and molecular-mechanics simulations. 

NWChem is available on almost all high performance computing platforms,
workstations, PCs running LINUX, as well as clusters of desktop platforms or
workgroup servers. NWChem development has been devoted to providing
maximum efficiency on massively parallel processors. It achieves this performance
on the 512 node IBM SP system in the EMSL's MSCF and on the 512 node CRAY
T3E-900 system in the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. It
has not been optimized for high performance on single processor desktop systems.

\section{Molecular electronic structure}

The following quantum mechanical methods are available to calculate
energies and analytic first derivatives with respect to atomic
coordinates.  Second derivatives are computed by finite difference of
the first derivatives.

\begin{itemize}
\item Self Consistent Field (SCF) or Hartree Fock (RHF, UHF, high-spin
  ROHF).  
\item Gaussian Density Functional Theory (DFT), using many local and
  non-local exchange-correlation potentials (RHF or UHF)
with formal $N^3$ and $N^4$ scaling.
\item Spin-orbit DFT (SODFT), using many local and non-local
  exchange-correlation potentials (UHF).
\item MP2 including semi-direct using frozen core and RHF and UHF reference.
\item Complete active space SCF (CASSCF).

\end{itemize}

The following methods are available to compute energies only.  First
and second derivatives are computed by finite difference of the
energies.
\begin{itemize}
\item CCSD, CCSD(T), CCSD+T(CCSD), with RHF reference.
\item Selected-CI with second-order perturbation correction.
\item MP2 fully-direct with RHF reference.
\item Resolution of the identity integral approximation MP2 (RI-MP2), with
  RHF and UHF reference.
\end{itemize}

For all methods, the following operations may be performed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Single point energy
\item Geometry optimization (minimization and transition state)
\item Molecular dynamics on the fully {\em ab initio} potential energy
  surface
\item Numerical first and second derivatives automatically computed if
  analytic derivatives are not available
\item Normal mode vibrational analysis in cartesian coordinates

\item Generation of the electron density file for graphical display
\item Evaluation of static, one-electron properties.
\item Electrostatic potential fit of atomic partial charges (CHELPG method with
    optional RESP restraints or charge constraints)
\end{itemize}

For closed and open shell SCF and DFT:

 for the Hartree-Fock method and its gradients.
\item One-electron spin-orbit effects can be included via spin-orbit potentials.
 This option is available for DFT and its gradients, but has to be run without 
 symmetry.
\end{itemize}

\item Free energy simulation  (multistep thermodynamic perturbation (MSTP) or
    multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration (MCTI) methods with
    options of single and/or dual topologies, double wide sampling, and
    separation-shifted scaling)

    mechanical methods capable of returning gradients.
