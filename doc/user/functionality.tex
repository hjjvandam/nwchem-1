\section{Molecular electronic structure}

The following methods are available with energies and analytic first
derivatives w.r.t. atomic coordinates.  Second derivatives are
computed by finite difference of first derivatives.
\begin{itemize}
\item Self Consistent Field or Hartree Fock (RHF, UHF, high-spin
  ROHF).  Analytic second derivatives in alpha testing.  
\item Gaussian Density Functional Theory (DFT) with many local and
  non-local exchange-correlation potentials (RHF and UHF).
\item MP2 semi-direct with frozen core with RHF and UHF reference.
\item Coupled-cluster single and double excitations (CCSD) with RHF
  reference.
\item Complete active space SCF (CASSCF).
\end{itemize}

The following methods are available with energies only.  First and
second derivatives are computed by finite difference of the energy.
\begin{itemize}
\item MP3, MP4, CCSD(T) (RHF reference).
\item Selected-CI with second-order perturbation correction.
\item MP2 fully-direct (RHF reference).
\item Resolution of the identity integral approximation MP2 (RI-MP2)
  (RHF and UHF reference).
\end{itemize}

For all methods, the following operations may be performed
\begin{itemize}
\item Single point energy.
\item Geometry Optimization (Minimization and Transition State).
\item Numerical first and second derivatives automatically computed if
  analytic derivatives are not available.
\item Generation of the electron density file for the {\em Insight}
      graphical program.
\end{itemize}

In addition, automatic interfaces are provided to
\begin{itemize}
\item The COLUMBUS multi-reference CI package.
\item The natural bond orbital package.
\end{itemize}

\section{Periodic system electronic structure}

Currently available are energies with Gaussian Density Functional
Theory (DFT) with many local and non-local exchange-correlation
potentials.

\section{Molecular dynamics}

The following functionality is available for classical molecular
simulations
\begin{itemize}
\item Single configuration energy evaluation
\item Energy minimization
\item Molecular dynamics simulation
\item Free energy simulation 
\end{itemize}
