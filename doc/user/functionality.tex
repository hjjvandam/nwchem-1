\label{sec:functionality}

Current functionality includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Self Consistent Field or Hartree Fock energy and analytic
  gradients (RHF, UHF, high-spin ROHF).  Analytic second derivatives
  under development.
\item Gaussian Density Functional Theory (DFT) energy and analytic
  gradients with many local and non-local exchange-correlation potentials
\item MP2 semi-direct energy and analytic gradients for RHF and UHF
  references (frozen core under development).  Direct MP2 energy (RHF
  only) and resolution of the identity (RI) integral approximation MP2
  (RHF and UHF).
\item Coupled-cluster (RHF) with linear triples (gradients under
  development).
\item Complete active space SCF (CASSCF) energy (gradients under
  development).
\item Selected-CI with perturbation correction energy.
\item First derivatives for all methods by numerical difference of the
  energy if analytic derivative is not available.
\item Second derivatives by numerical difference of gradients if
  analytic seconds are not available.
\item Geometry Optimization (Minimization and Transition State) for
  all methods.
\item Generation of the electron density file for the {\em Insight}
      graphical program.
\item Interface to the natural bond orbital package.
\item Interface to the COLUMBUS multi-reference CI package.
\end{itemize}
