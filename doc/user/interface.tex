NWChem has interfaces to several different packages which are listed below.
In general, the NWChem authors work with the authors of the other packages
to make sure that the interface works.  However, any problems with the 
interface should be reported to the
{\tt nwchem-support@emsl.pnl.gov} e-mail list.

\section{NBO --- Natural Bond Orbital Analysis}
\label{sec:nbo}
\begin{verbatim}
  NBO
    ...
  END
\end{verbatim}

This directive is used to run the NBO package within NWChem.  (To only print
out an input file for NBO, see Section \ref{sec:Nbofile}.)  Currently, this
analysis module only runs sequentially.  This restriction will soon go away.

Inside the NBO block are the typical commands that would be needed for NBO
(Please see an NBO user's manual for more information.).  The following
directive is needed to execute NBO.
\begin{verbatim}
task nbo
\end{verbatim}
As an example:

\begin{verbatim}
title "Methylamine...rhf/3-21g//Pople-Gordon standard geometry"

start methylamine

 N library 3-21g
 H library 3-21g
end
