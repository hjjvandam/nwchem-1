\section{nbofile}
Following the successful completion of an electronic structure
calculation, a Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis may be carried out
in the following way.  On restart specify the TASK as PROPERTY and
supply the sub-directive NBOFILE to the PROPERTY directive.  NWchem
will query the rtdb and construct an ascii file,
\verb+<file_prefix>.gen+, that may be used as input to the stand alone
version of the NBO program, gennbo.  \verb+<file_prefix>+ is equal to
string following the RESTART directive.  The input deck may be edited
to provide additional options to the NBO calculation, (see the NBO
user's manual for details.)
