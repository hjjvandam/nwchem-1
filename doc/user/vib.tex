The vibrational frequencies can be computed by finite difference for
SCF and DFT wavefunctions currently.  Drivers for other wavefunctions
will be developed as required.  The vibrational package was integrated
from the Utah Messkit and can use any hessian generated from the
driver routines.  This is classified as a ``fragile module'' since the
integration is not complete.

\subsection{VIB input: project}
{\it The input module for vib is under development and incomplete.}
The VIB module can project out the translations and rotations of the
hessian using the standard Eckart projection algorithm.  To set this
option you must enter the following in your input deck.

\begin{verbatim}
  set "vib:project" logical true
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{VIB input: zero point energy}
{\it The input module for vib is under development and incomplete.}
The VIB module can also compute the zero point energy for the
molecular system.  This will automatically set the projection flag to
remove the translations and rotations.   To compute the zero point energy
you must enter the following in your input deck.

\begin{verbatim}
  set "vib:zero point energy" logical true
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{VIB known problems}
\begin{itemize}
\item Currently there is no direct way to set masses for atoms not
  already in the vibrational code.  ({\it {\bf Note:} this is
    currently being addressed}).  The default masses used by the VIB
  module are:
