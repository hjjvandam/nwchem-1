{\bf This is junk ... I'm reworking it.}

The NWChem multiconfiguration SCF (MCSCF) module can currently perform
complete active space SCF (CASSCF) calculations with at most 20 active
orbitals and about 500 basis functions.

\begin{verbatim}
  MCSCF
    ACTIVE <integer nactive>

    ACTELEC <integer nactelec>

    MULTIPLICITY <integer multiplicity>

    [SYMMETRY <integer symmetry default 1>]

    [VECTORS [[input] <string input_file default $file_prefix$.movecs>] 
           [swap <integer vec1 vec2> ...] \
           [output <string output_file default input_file>] \
           [lock]

    [HESSIAN (exact||onel)]

    [MAXITER <integer maxiter default 20>]

    [THRESH  <real thresh default 1.0e-4>]

    [TOL2E <real tol2e default 1.0e-9>]

    [LEVEL <real shift default 0.1d0>]
  END
\end{verbatim}
Note that the \verb+ACTIVE+, \verb+ACTELEC+, and \verb+MULTIPLICITY+
directives are {\em required}.

\subsection{{\tt ACTIVE} --- Number of active orbitals}

The number of orbitals in the CASSCF active space must be specified
using the {\tt ACTIVE} directive.

E.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
  active 10
\end{verbatim}

The input molecular orbtials (see the vectors directive, Sections
\ref{sec:mcscfvectors} and \ref{sec:vectors}) must be arranged in
order
\begin{enumerate}
\item doubly occupied orbitals,
\item active orbitals, and
\item unoccupied orbitals.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{{\tt ACTELEC} --- Number of active electrons}

The number of electrons in the CASSCF active space must be specified
using the the {\tt ACTELEC} directive.  An error is reported if the
number of active electrons and the multiplicity are inconsistent.

The number of closed shells is determined by subtracting the number
of active electrons from the total number of electrons (which in turn
is derived from the sum of the nuclear charges minus the total system
charge).

\subsection{{\tt MULTIPLICITY}}

The spin multiplicity must be specified and is enforced by projection
of the determinant wavefunction.

E.g., to obtain a triplet state
\begin{verbatim}
  multiplicity 3
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{{\tt SYMMETRY} --- Spatial symmetry of the wavefunction}

This species the irreducible representation of the wavefunction as an
integer in the range 1---8 using the same numbering of representations
as output by the SCF program.  Note that only Abelian point groups are
supported.

E.g., to specify a $B_1$ state when using the $C_{2v}$ group
\begin{verbatim}
  symmetry 3
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{{\tt VECTORS} --- Input/output of MO vectors}
\label{sec:mcscfvectors}

Calculations are best started from RHF/ROHF molecular orbitals (see
Section \ref{sec:scf}), and by default vectors are taken from the
previous MCSCF or SCF calculation.  To specify another input file use
the \verb+VECTORS+ directive.  Vectors are by default output to the
input file, and may be redirected using the \verb+output+ keyword.
The \verb+swap+ keyword of the \verb+VECTORS+ directive may be
used to reorder orbitals to obtain the correct active space.
See Section \ref{sec:vectors} for an example.

Output orbitals of a converged MCSCF calculation are canonicalized as
follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Doubly occupied and occupied orbitals diagonalize the
  corresponding blocks of an effective Fock operator.
\item Active orbitals are chosen as natural orbitals by
  diagonalization of the active space 1-particle density matrix.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{{\tt HESSIAN} --- Select preconditioner}
\label{sec:mcscfhessian}

The MCSCF will use a one-electron approximation to the orbital-orbital
Hessian until some degree of convergence is obtained, whereupon it
will attempt to use the exact orbital-orbital Hessian which makes the
micro iterations more expensive but potentially reduces the total
number of macro iterations.  Either choice may be forced throughout
the calculation by specifying the appropriate keyword on the
\verb+HESSIAN+ directive.

E.g., to speficy the one-electron approximation throughout
\begin{verbatim}
  hessian onel
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{{\tt LEVEL} --- Level shift for convergence}

The Hessian (Section \ref{sec:mcscfhessian}) used in the MCSCF
optimization is by default level shifted by 0.1 until the orbital
gradient norm falls below 0.01, at which point the level shift is
reduced to zero.  The initial value of $0.1$ may be changed using
the \verb+LEVEL+ directive.  Increasing the level shift may make
convergence more stable in some instances.

E.g., to set the initial level shift to 0.5
\begin{verbatim}
  level 0.5
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{{\tt PRINT} and {\tt NOPRINT}}

Specific output items can selectively enabled or disabled using the
\verb+print+ control mechanism~(\ref{sec:printcontrol}) with the
available print options listed in table(\ref{MCSCF_print_options}).
