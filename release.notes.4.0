NWChem Version 4.0 Release Notes
(Also available at http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/pub/docs/nwchem/support/release.4.0.html)

NOTE: These release notes are not a substitute for reading the User Manual!
They are meant to give a thumbnail sketch of the new capabilities and bug
fixes that are available in NWChem Version 4.0. When there is a conflict
between the release notes and the User Manual, the User Manual takes
precedence. 

Several new major capabilities are available in NWChem, including several new
modules. The new modules are: 

  o 

For each of these capabilities, the user is referred to the User Manual for more
information. 

Additional major additions to the capabilities include: 

  o The Douglas-Kroll(-Hess) approach is implemented. It can be used at all levels 
    of theory. Gradients have been implementing allowing for Douglas-Kroll including 
    geometry optimizations and frequencies
  o Inclusion of code to evaluate relativistic integrals based on Dyall's modified Dirac
    (DmD) equation. This provides a one-electron approximation very similar to the
    Douglas-Kroll-Hess approach. Gradients are also available for this method.

Again, for each of these capabilities, the user is referred to the User Manual for
more information. 

Listed below are the other major and many minor changes for each module
with significant changes. These descriptions are somewhat terse and more
information is generally available in the User Manual. 

Task level directives: 

  o Addition of RELATIVISTIC directive to control evaluation of relativistic integrals.

Initial orbital Guess: 

  o 

Basis Sets: 

  o Basis set library has been updated to include all new basis sets at the EMSL
    Gaussian Basis Set Order Form page of David Feller 
    (http://www.emsl.pnl.gov:2080/forms/basisform.html)
  o Relativistic contractions of the cc-pvnz, n = 2--5, basis sets for the DmD 
    approximations.

Geometry: 

  o Inclusion of a finite Gaussian nuclear charge distribution.
  o Inclusion of velocities for QMD and PSPW.

DFT: 

  o 

SCF: 

  o 

Driver: 

  o 

Properties: 

  o The user is now allowed to choose the point of expansion for dipole,
    quadrupole, and octupole.  See CENTER directive.
  o The center for expansion for dipole, quadrupole and octupole has changed
    from the center of mass to the center of charge.  This behavior can be 
    changed by using the CENTER directive.

MP2: 

  o 

Hessian and Frequencies: 

  o 

ESP: 

  o 

Prepare module: 

  o 

MD: 

  o 

Integral changes: 

  o Douglas-Kroll(-Hess) integral routines have been added.
  o Relativistic one-electron integral routines for the DmD approach have been added.

Tests, manuals and misc script changes: 

  o Updated User's Manual to reflect new and modified functionality in
    NWChem. 
  o QA tests have been updated to reflect the new functionality in NWChem. 
  o 
  o Updates in the Programmer's Manual (much more is still left to come!). 

Installation availability: 

The current tested platforms and O/S versions are: 

  o IBM SP with P2SC nodes, AIX 4.2.1, and PSSP 2.3 
  o IBM SP with silver nodes (SMP nodes with two 604e processors), AIX
    4.3.2, and PSSP 3.1. 
  o IBM RS6000 workstation, AIX 3.2, 4.1. and 4.3 
  o Cray T3E, 2.0.4.61 UNICOSMK 
  o SGI R8000/10000, IRIX 6.2, 6.5 
  o SGI R4000, IRIX 5.3 
  o SUN workstations, SunOS 4.1.3 and Solaris 5.5 
  o Compaq DEC alpha workstion (600 MHz EV6), Digital UNIX V4.0E Rev.
    1091, DEC C V5.8-009, Digital Fortran V5.2 
  o Linux. Since there are at least 8 popular distributions of the Linux
    operating system and numerous others in existence, including
    downloading everything and building your own Linux OS, it is impossible
    to test all possible versions of Linux with NWChem. NWChem Release 4.0
    has been tested on Slackware 3.4, 3.5, 4.0, RedHat 5.1, 5.2, and 6.0,
    Mandrake based on RedHat 6.0, and RedHat 6.0 for the Power PC
    Macintosh. These all use the EGCS compilers at different levels. Those
    distributed from Slackware are somewhat different than those distributed
    from RedHat but the code is configured to run on all of them. The Linux
    Alpha version 5.2 from Red Hat fails to compile the code as well as the beta
    release of the Digital Fortran compiler for Linux based Alpha systems.
