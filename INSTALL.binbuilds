INSTALLING NWCHEM FOR GENERAL SITE USE: 
--------------------------------------
   To extract the tar file you will need to issue one of the following
commands (or any equivalent variant).
   1) tar xvf nwchem-*******.tar
   2) cat nwchem-******.tar.Z | uncompress | tar xvf -
   3) gunzip -c nwchem-******.tar.gz | tar xvf -

   After the tar file has been expanded the following file and
directory structure will exist.  

regular file          -      ./INSTALL.binbuilds 
directory             -      ./bin 
directory             -      ./classes
directory             -      ./data 
directory             -      ./etc

A) The file ./INSTALL.binbuilds is this file you are reading.

B) The ./bin directory contains the binaries used for the given build
   on the target machine.  There will be an nwchem executable and any
   other associated files that are necessary for the target platform.

C) The ./classes directory has the Java class files for the NWChem
   support tool.  This is to be used by the desginated point of
   contact at each site.  See the description below.
D) The ./data directory has the basis set library and the default
   amber and charmm parameter files used for molecular dynamics
   simulations. 
E) The ./etc directory has an executable c-shell script to generate a
   default ".nwchemrc" file that enables nwchem to find the data files.
   Each user will need a .nwchemrc file to point to these default data
   files (e.g., those in ./data).  The global generated by the c-shell
   script in ./etc can be used as the target of a symbolic link in
   each users $HOME directory. Users would have to issue the following
   command prior to using NWChem: 
   ln -s /usr/local/NWChem/data/default.nwchemrc $HOME/.nwchemrc

   Of course users can copy this file instead of making the symbolic
   link described above and change these defaults at their discretion.


POINT OF CONTACT USERS:
----------------------
   If you are the NWChem point-of-contact for a given site please
build and use the java tool in .../classes/NWChem.class.  You need
java 1.1.1 or higher to use the tool.  This form formats information
and allows the attachment of input and output files via a simple
browsing mechanism.  Use of this tool will greatly facilitate any
support you may need for using NWChem.  

The file .../classes/report_nwchem is a c-shell script that can be
used AFTER modification to properly run the Javaa based NWChem support
tool.
