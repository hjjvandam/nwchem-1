dft_bsse: 

   Trunk version loses the Bq centers although they have basis functions on them.

pyqa:

   Prints the contents of the RTDB. However, in the trunk version these arrays
   are much longer than in the release. As a result this really polutes the output.

   The dispersion correction does not seem to get included.

   Fails, but worked in 5.1.1
