dft_bsse: 

   Trunk version loses the Bq centers although they have basis functions
   on them.

pyqa:

   Prints the contents of the RTDB. However, in the trunk version these arrays
   are much longer than in the release. As a result this really polutes the
   output.

pspw_stress:

   The Mulliken charges are very different from the 6.0 release data and the
   current baseline.

pspw_SiC:

   The Mulliken charges are very different from the 6.0 release data and the
   current baseline.

vectors_rotate:

   The multipole analysis shows results that seem significantly different from
   what they should be and are in 6.0 release.

h2o-ssb-d:

   The dispersion correction does not seem to get included.

h2o-ssb-d-opt:

   The dispersion correction does not seem to get included.

tce_polar_ccsdt_small:

   Not tested with 6.0, because CCSDTLR is not compiled in by default

tce_c20_triplet:

   Not tested with 6.0, because it took 256 cores 2 hours on MPP2

bsse_dft_trimer:

   Fails, but worked in 5.1.1

h2o_selci:

   Fails, but worked in 5.1.1

h3_dirdyvtst:

   Genreates very different results than baseline, but same as 5.1.1

k6h2o:

   Generates runtime errors, just like 5.1.1 version - Marat
   has been asked about it

lysH-qmmm:

   Generates runtime errors, just like 5.1.1 version - Marat 
   has been asked about it

tce_qmmm_ccsd_grad:

   Fails, just like in 5.1.1 - Asked Karol about it

tce_qmmm_ccsd_opt:

   Fails, just like in 5.1.1 - Asked Karol about it

tce_qmmm_eomccsd_grad:

   Fails, just like in 5.1.1 - Asked Karol about it

tce_qmmm_eomccsd_opt:

   Fails, just like in 5.1.1 - Asked Karol about it
