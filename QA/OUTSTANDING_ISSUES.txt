dft_bsse: 

   Trunk version loses the Bq centers although they have basis functions on them.

pyqa:

   Prints the contents of the RTDB. However, in the trunk version these arrays
   are much longer than in the release. As a result this really polutes the output.

vectors_rotate:

   The trunk multipole analysis is very different from the 6.0 release, which 
   is not surprising since it is singlet O2, and thus very touchy

h2o-ssb-d:

   The dispersion correction does not seem to get included in trunk

h2o-ssb-d-opt:

   The dispersion correction does not seem to get included in trunk

tce_polar_ccsdt_small:

   Not yet tested with 6.0, because CCSDTLR is not compiled in by default

tce_c20_triplet:

   Not yet tested with 6.0, because it took 256 cores 2 hours on MPP2

bsse_dft_trimer:

   Fails, but worked in 5.1.1

h2o_selci:

   Fails, but worked in 5.1.1

h3_dirdyvtst:

   Genreates very different results than baseline, but same as 5.1.1

k6h2o:

   Generates runtime errors, just like 5.1.1 version - Marat has been asked about it

lysH-qmmm:
