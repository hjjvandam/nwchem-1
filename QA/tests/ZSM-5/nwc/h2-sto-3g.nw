# HF/STO-3G calculation on H2
#
# This calculation reproduces the results of Joseph W. Ochterski in 
# "Thermochemistry in Gaussian", June 2, 2000. See:
# https://gaussian.com/wp-content/uploads/dl/thermo.pdf [accessed Oct 21, 2023]
# The thermochemistry results in the output can be compared to the
# results Ochterski listed in Table 1. This should help with calculating 
# free energies from NWChem outputs.
