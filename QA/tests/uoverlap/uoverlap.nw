#From various tests on Si2H6 MP2 gradients (aug-TZ basis) and the following
#Uranium input I think that the default (standard) integral accuracy needs
#to be increased.  I would recommend 10^-15 being standard, though I only
#tested the following with an accuracy of 10^-20 (by hacking int_acc_std).

#The following input gives spurious zero overlap eigenvalues with the
#default integral accuracy of 1e-20.  Increasing to 10^-20 fixes it.


#For robust convergence start U6+ from the converged Rn solution
