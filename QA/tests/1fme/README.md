# README for 1FME

This example is a test case that was used for the development of 
DeepDriveMD (see https://github.com/DeepDriveMD). The protein
[1FME](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1FME) is a small protein
of only 28 residues. Starting from an unfolded state we can
explore the protein folding process. In DeepDriveMD this folding
process was accelerated with machine learning [1].
