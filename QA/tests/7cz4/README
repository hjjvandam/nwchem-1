NSP3 Macrodomain structure
==========================

09/24/2021:
   The original structure is 7CZ4 (stored in 7cz4.pdb).
10/01/2021: 
   Hydrogen atoms were added with Molprobity (http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/)
   the result is stored in 7cz4FH.pdb
10/03/2021:
   Turns out that the original structure has missing heavy atoms.
   Generated 7cz4_fixed.pdb by running 7cz4.pdb through pdbfixer with
   the command:
   pdbfixer 7cz4.pdb --add-atoms=heavy
   Feeding the result through Molprobity generated 7cz4_fixedFH.pdb
   The run:
   pdbfixer 7cz4_fixedFH.pdb --add-atoms=hydrogen
   to add the Hydrogen at the N-termini (which Molprobity ignores for some reason)
   to generate 7cz4_fixedFH_allH.pdb
   Finally the fact that the two APR residues had the same residue id caused
   problems. Because the two residues appeared in succession with the same name
   and the same residue id NWChem was not able to detect they were two different
   instances of the same residue (the code seems to ignore the chain id). 
   Renumbering the second instance fixed this issue (7cz4_fixedFH_allH_nwc.pdb).
   Finally, the active protein is in monomer form (https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00441)
   hence we removed chain B to get a structure that is close to the solution
   structure. This structure is stored in 7cz4_fixedFH_allH_nwc_small.pdb
