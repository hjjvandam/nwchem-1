# The two parameters in this file were needed to get the caa test case to work.
# The parameters were simply copied from something else and the atom names
# adjusted so that the required force field parameters are found. However,
# the values listed here have no scientific justification. Therefore, if you
# have an application that needs these parameters DO NOT use the ones listed
# here!!!
