NWChem Version 4.5 Release Notes
(Also available at 
http://www.emsl.pnl.gov:2080/docs/nwchem/release-notes/release.notes.4.5.html)

NOTE: These release notes are not a substitute for reading the User Manual!
They are meant to give a thumbnail sketch of the new capabilities and bug
fixes that are available in NWChem Version 4.5. When there is a conflict
between the release notes and the User Manual, the User Manual takes
precedence. 

The changes for version 4.1 are listed at the bottom of this file.

Several new major capabilities are available in NWChem, including several new
modules. The new modules are: 

  o TCE: Tensor Contraction Engine module, that can generate
unrestricted CISD, CISDT, CISDTQ, LCCD, CCD, LCCSD, CCSD, QCISD,
CCSDT, CCSDT, MBPT(2), MBPT(3), MBPT(4) wavefunctions.
  o TDDT: time-dependendent DFT
  o ET: Electron Transfre module that calculates the electron transfer
matrix element between ET reactant and product states   

For each of these capabilities, the user is referred to the User
Manual for more information. 

Additional major additions to the capabilities include: 
  o DFT: added the following new functional MPW91, MPW91K, FT97, 
         XPKBZ99 (meta-GGA)
  o 

Again, for each of these capabilities, the user is referred to the User Manual 
for more information. 

Listed below are the other major and many minor changes for each module
with significant changes. These descriptions are somewhat terse and more
information is generally available in the User Manual. 

Note: Due to changes in the runtime database structure, RESTART
will not work on database files generated by NWChem versions 4.0.1 and 
older.

Top level directives:

  o BUG FIX: 

Basis Sets: 

  o BUG FIX: re-introduced cc-pcvqz and its polarization functions.
  o basis set is printed if the "*" tag input is used
  o BUG FIX: improper detection of basis libraries directory on HP Tru64
  o BUG FIX: wrong dimension for temporary array used when detecting
    atom types.  

Geometry: 
  
  o added option to freeze number of orbitals in the molecule
  o BUG FIX: xyz_print is now printing angstroms instead of fractional
    coordinates for 3-d geometries.
  o BUG FIX: z-matrix input modified to  digest
    symbols bq"atomic symbol" x"atomic symbol" needed for DFT BSSE
  o BUG FIX: power

DFT: 

  o New density functionals, 

SCF: 

  o BUG FIX: 

RIMP2

  o Fortran Direct I/O have been converted to EAF calls: this allows
    to overcome the 2GB filesize limit.

COSMO:
  
  o BUG FIX: 

Driver: 

  o BUG FIX: fraction coordinates optimizer
  o NEB (Nudged Elastice Band) method added

Properties: 

  o 

MP2: 

  o 

Hessian and Frequencies: 

  o BUG FIX: 

NBO:
  o static memory allocation increased 6x to allow run on larger systems
  o BUG FIX: use of OPEN(STATUS="REPLACE") (on fortran compiler that 
    allows it)  to avoid a fatal error when a file exists because a
    job  with the same name was carried out in the same
    directory before
  o BUG FIX: normalization factors for f orbitals transformation

Vib:

  o Partial canonical partition thermodynamical analysis added

PSPW:

  o 

Prepare:

  o 

MD: 

  o 

Analysis:

  o 


QM/MM:

  o 

Integral changes: 

  o Default value for integral internal screening threshold has been
    raised from 1E-15 to 1E-12.

Effective core potentials:

  o BUG FIX: 

Relativistic:
 
  o 

DPLOT:

  o DPLOT available during Car-Parrinello simulations.

Tests, manuals and miscellaneous script changes: 

  o Updated User's Manual to reflect new and modified functionality in
    NWChem. 
  o QA tests have been updated to reflect the new functionality.


Installation availability: 

The current tested platforms and O/S versions are: 

  o IBM SP with Power 3 and Power 4 nodes, AIX 5.1
    and PSSP 3.4; IBM RS6000 workstation, AIX 5.1. Xlf 8.1.0.0 and
    8.1.0.1 are known to produce bad code.
  o SGI R8000/10000/12000 IRIX 6.5 
  o SUN workstations with Solaris 2.6 and 2.8. Fujitsu SPARC systems 
   (thanks to Herbert Fruchtl) with Parallelnavi compilers.
  o HP DEC alpha workstation , Tru64 V5.1,
    Compaq Fortran V5.3, V5.4.2, V5.5.1
  o Linux with Intel x86 cpus. Since there are at least 8 popular
    distributions of the Linux operating system and numerous others in
    existence, including downloading everything and building your own Linux OS,
    it is impossible to test all possible versions of Linux with NWChem.
    NWChem Release 4.5 has been tested on, RedHat 6.x and 7.x,
    Mandrake  7.x.
    We have tested NWChem on Linux for the Power PC Macintosh with
    Yellow Dog 2.1.
    These all use the GCC compiler at different levels. 
    The Intel Fortran Compiler version 7 is supported.
    However, the Portland Group Compiler has 
    been tested in a less robust manner.
  o HP 9000/800 workstations with  HPUX B.11.00. f90 must be used for
    compilation.
  o Intel x86 with Windows 2000 has been tested with Compaq Visual Fortran
    6.0 and 6.1 with WMPI 1.3 or NT-Mpich.
  o Intel IA64 under Linux (with Intel compilers) and under HPUX.
