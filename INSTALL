  DO THESE STEPS IN ORDER OR THE BUILD WILL FAIL
                                       ----


1) You must use GNU make with a version of at least 3.71. You can
   check this by seeing if make understands the "-v" flag.  It does
   not matter what make is called (.i.e., gmake, gnumake, etc., are
   all OK).

2) Set the environment variable, NWCHEM_TOP, to the top directory 
   of the NWChem tree (where *this* file lives), e.g.

       % setenv NWCHEM_TOP /home/adrian/nwchem

   All the following directions assume that the current working
   directory is $NWCHEM_TOP/src.
   so issue the command "cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src"

3)  The currently supported platforms are:

    Symb.Name  Platform               OS/Version    Precision
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    SUN         Sun                    SunOS        double
    SOLARIS     Sun                    Solaris 2.X  double
    IBM         IBM RS/6000            AIX 3.x 4.s  double
    DECOSF      DEC AXP                OSF/1        double
    SGI         SGI 32 bit os          IRIX 5.x 6.x double
    SGITFP      SGI 64 bit os          IRIX         double
    SGI_N32     SGI 64 bit os          IRIX         double 
                using 32 ints
    CRAY-T3D    Cray T3D               UNICOS       single
    CRAY-T3E    Cray T3E               UNICOS       single
    PARAGON     Intel Paragon          OSF/1        double
    DELTA       Intel Delta            NX           double
    SP1         IBM SP1,SP2            AIX          double
    ----------------------------------------------------------

   Set the environment variable, NWCHEM_TARGET, to the symbolic name
   that matches your target platform, e.g.

       % setenv NWCHEM_TARGET SP1

   Some systems also require that you set NWCHEM_TARGET_CPU
    Symb.Name      CPU type     NWCHEM_TARGET_CPU 
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    SGITFP         R8000           R8000
                   R10000          R10000
    SGI_N32        R8000           R8000
                   R10000          R10000
    SP1            Power 2         DO __NOT__ set NWCHEM_TARGET_CPU
                   Power 2 super   P2SC
                   604e chip       604
    
4) Configure to build the modules you need.  As a first shot build
   everything, and if you start running out of memory you can exclude
   modules.  Choose one or more from

        Name        Description
        -----------------------------------------
        all         Everything
        qm          All quantum mechanics modules
	ddscf       RHF and UHF SCF energies
        nwdft       DFT energies
        gradients   SCF gradients
	dftgrad     DFT gradients
        stepper     Geometry optimization
        moints      4-index
        rimp2       RI-MP2
        ccsd        CCSD & CCSD(T)
        property    Properties analysis
        -----------------------------------------

    To configure to build everything use the command

       % cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src
       % make nwchem_config NWCHEM_MODULES=all
    OR 
       % cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src
       % setenv NWCHEM_MODULES all
       % make nwchem_config

5) Run the precision conversion according to the Precision column
   above for your target. This is necessary only on machines where 64
   bit is single precision in order to match BLAS routine names to
   vendor-supplied libraries (or if converting back from such source
   into the standard of 64 bit is double precision).

   For 64 bit single precision source

       % cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src
       % make dbl_to_sngl

6) Finally, compile and link:

       % make >& make.log

   This should install the executables and libraries into
   platform-specific subdirectories in the directory tree. For
   example, if the target platform equals SP1 then the following
   subdirectories are created:

	$NWCHEM_TOP/bin/SP1          (executables)
        $NWCHEM_TOP/lib/SP1          (libraries)


   An alternative to steps 2 thru 6 is to specify all variables
   on the make command line.  This is recommended only for one
   time builds.  For instance, to build just the quantum mechanical
   codes on an IBM workstation

       make NWCHEM_TOP=/home/nwchem NWCHEM_TARGET=IBM NWCHEM_MODULES=qm


NOTE TO MPI USERS:
-----------------

   NWChem can be compiled to use MPI instead of TCGMSG for message
   passing on many systems, though this is still somewhat experimental
   and not particulary tested it can be done.  Please contact 
   nwchem-support@emsl.pnl.gov to get assistance with this procedure.
