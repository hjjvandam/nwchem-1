  DO THESE STEPS IN ORDER OR THE BUILD WILL FAIL
                                       ----


1)  The compilation will only work with "GNU" make as the
    default make in your path. You can check this by seeing 
    if make understands the "-v" flag.


2)  Set the environment variable, NWCHEM_TOP, to the
    directory where *this* file lives, e.g.

       % setenv NWCHEM_TOP /home/adrian/nwchem

    All the following directions assume that the current
    working directory is $NWCHEM/src.


3)  The currently supported platforms are:

    Symb.Name  Platform               OS/Version    Precision
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    SUN         Sun                    SunOS        double
    IBM         IBM RS/6000            AIX          double
    DECOSF      DEC AXP                OSF/1        double
    SGI         SGI ?                  IRIX         double
    SGITFP      SGI Power Challenge    IRIX         double
    CRAY_T3D    Cray T3D               UNICOS       single
    PARAGON     Intel Paragon          OSF/1        double
    DELTA       Intel Delta            NX           double
    SP1         IBM SP1,SP2            AIX          double
    KSR         KSR2                   KSR OS       single
    ----------------------------------------------------------

    Set the environment variable, NWCHEM_TARGET, to the
    symbolic name that matches your target platform, e.g.

       % setenv NWCHEM_TARGET PARAGON

4)  Configure to build the modules you need.  As a first shot
    build everything, and if you start running out of memory
    you can exclude modules.  Choose one or more from

        Name        Description
        -------------------------------------
	ddscf       RHF and UHF SCF energies
        nwdft       DFT energies
        gradients   SCF gradients
	dftgrad     DFT gradients
        stepper     Geometry optimization
        moints      4-index
        rimp2       RI-MP2
        ccsd        CCSD & CCSD(T)
        -------------------------------------

    To configure to build everything use the command

       % cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src
       % make nwchem_config NWCHEM_MODULES=all

5)  Run the precision conversion according to the Precision
    column above for your target. This is necessary only 
    on machines where 64 bit is single precision in order 
    to match BLAS routine names to vendor-supplied libraries
    (or if converting back from such source into the standard
    of 64 bit is double precision).

    For 64 bit single precision source

       % make dbl_to_sngl


6)  Make any missing directories

       % make directories

7)  Finally, compile and link:
       % make >& make.log
    This should install the executables and libraries
    into platform-specific subdirectories in the directory
    tree. For example, if the target platform equals PARAGON
    then the following subdirectories are created:

	$NWCHEM_TOP/bin/PARAGON          (executables)
        $NWCHEM_TOP/lib/PARAGON          (libraries)
